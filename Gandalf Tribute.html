    <h2>Gandalf's greatest Deeds </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Gandalf arrived in Middle Earth early in the Third Age. Upon his arrival, he was gifted Narya, one of the Elven Rings of Power by Cirdan the shipwright. </li>
      <br>
      <li> During his travels, he would develop a relationship with the Hobbits of the Shire. A seemingly small and insignificant people, though they would prove to be crucial to the fate of Middle Earth. 
      </li>
      <br>
     
      <li> As the company of Thorin Oakenshield entered Mirkwood, Gandalf split off from the group, for he had pressing business to attend to. He would meet with the White Council, that is, Saruman the White Wizard, Galadriel of Lorien, Elrond of Rivendell, and Cirdan the shipwright of the Grey Havens. Together, they would attack Dol Guldur, where the Dark Lord Sauron was reappearing, and drive him out.</li>
      <br>
  <li> Gandalf would later aid and guide the ringbearer Frodo Baggins as a member of The Fellowship of The Ring. He would lead the Fellowship through a long and desperate journey through Moria. Here, he would meet his match in the form of a Balrog. He would fall into the depths with the Balrog, and a fierce battle they would have, Though it would result in the death of Gandalf the Grey.</li>
      <br>
    <li> However, being one of the Maiar, and his task of aiding the free peoples against Sauron being incomplete, he would be sent back. This time, as Gandalf the White, taking the position Saruman once held, before his betrayal.</li>
  <br>
      <li> He would go on to aid the Men of Rohan against Saruman's attempted conquest. Ending with Gandalf confronting Saruman at Orthanc, where he casts Saruman out of the order of the Istari and the White Council. </li>
      <br>
  <li> In order to help Frodo achieve his quest, Gandalf would advise the leaders of men to attack the Black Gate of Mordor as a diversion, so Frodo could pass through Mordor unseen, and complete his quest. </li>
  <br>
  <li> With the Ring destroyed, Sauron defeated, and the coronation of King Elessar completed, Gandalf's task was done. He would go on one final journey, to return to his old home in Valinor.</li>
